There are no comments in the code.

But here is how to run it.
Put all the files in the same folder.
Be sure to include the file "test_database.csv"
Location is in "Search.java", change to where the files are located.

>> open cmd
>> cd "Folder where stuff is"
>> javac Main.java
>> java Main
